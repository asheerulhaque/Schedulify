Project Requirements:
Your task is to design and implement a web application with the following features:

User-Facing Features:

Calendar View: 
 Users should be able to view a calendar with available time slots for appointments. 
 The calendar should display all days of the month. The calendar should be set up to show the entire month at a glance, 
 just like the easy-to-understand calendar you see on platforms like Calendly.

Booking: 
 Users should be able to select an available time slot and book an appointment.

Confirmation Email: 
 Upon booking confirmation, an email should be sent to the user confirming the appointment details.

Google Calendar Integration:
 An event should be created in the consultant's Google Calendar upon successful booking. 
 The user should be added as a guest to the event so they receive event notifications.

Consultant-Facing Features:


Availability Management: 
 Consultants should have an interface to set their availability. 
 This includes defining working hours, breaks, and days off.
